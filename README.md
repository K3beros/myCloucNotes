# Azure Fundamentals

This contains notes taken based on the skills definition for the azure fundamentals exam. This is only 
intended for study purposes:

### Describe Cloud Concepts


##### **Identify the benefits and considerations of using cloud services**

* Identify the benefits of cloud computing, such as High Availability, Scalability, Elasticity,
  Agility, and Disaster Recovery.

  *High Availability*: _Depending on the service-level agreement (SLA) that you choose, your cloud-based apps can provide a continuous user experience with no apparent downtime, even when things go wrong._
  
  *Scalability*:
    - *Vertically*: *Computing capacity can be increased by adding RAM or CPUs to a virtual machine.*
    - *Horizontally*: *Computing capacity can be increased by adding instances of a resource, such as adding more      virtual machines to your configuration.*
  
  *Elasticity*: *You can configure cloud-based apps to take advantage of autoscaling, so your apps always have the resources they need.*

  *Agility*: *Deploy and configure cloud-based resources quickly as your app requirements change.*

* Difference between Capital Expenditure(CapEx) and Operation Expenditure(OpEx)

  *CapEx is the upfront money spent on infrastructural development while OpEx is money spent on resources used now and being billed immediately.*

  *CapEx requires ongoing and support expenditures while OpEx is only responsible for computing resources it uses.*

* Describe consumption based model

  *End users only pay for resources they use. No upfront cost is required and users also have the ability to add more computing resources as they go along.*

##### **Describe the differences between categories of cloud services**

  * Describe the shared responsibility model
   
   *A shared responsibility model is a cloud security framework that dictates the security and availability obligations of a cloud computing provider and its users to ensure accountability.*

* Examples of cloud service models

  *Virtual Machine's ---> IaaS, Azure App Services ---> PaaS, Office 365 --> SaaS*
